# My Neovim configuration


Clone to `~/.config/nvim` and start [nvim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/INSTALL.md) (`>=0.10.0`) and lazy should take care of everything.

##Â Requirements

- [npx](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npx). Might need `sudo apt install npm && npm i -g npx`.
- To get full functionality, I recomment installing [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) and [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)
